Last week, I had the pleasure of joining (mt) chief correspondent, Sara Carter, on the <a href="http://supportops.co/6/" target="_new" rel="external">Support Ops podcast</a>. <a href="http://supportops.co/" target="_new" rel="external">Support Ops</a> is all about customer support. More specifically, bringing humanity to customer support. We had a fantastic time and I can't thank Chase Clemons enough for having us on the show.

Chase, who runs the Support Ops blog and podcast, is extremely passionate about providing great customer experiences. He currently works at <a href="http://37signals.com/" target="_new" rel="external">37signals</a>, a company I've always admired. I first came across his work through <a href="http://community.uservoice.com/blog/chase-clemons-37signals-userconf/" target="_new" rel="external">UserConf 2012</a>, a customer service conference about keeping your customers happy. You can watch his talk -- "Try New Stuff" -- right here:
